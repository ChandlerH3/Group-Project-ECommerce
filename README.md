## Setup
This is my group project that builds an e-commerce app using React, Node.JS, and MongoDB to showcase wearables products.

1. Open a terminal in VS Code
2. Type `cd client`
3. Type `yarn install`

Use `yarn start` to start the frontend environment.

### The Backend

1. Open _another_ terminal in VS Code
2. Type `cd server`
3. Type `yarn install`

Use `yarn start` to start the backend environment.
